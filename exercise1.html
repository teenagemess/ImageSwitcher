            Technology has eliminated the basement darkroom and the whole notion of photography as an intense 
            labor of love for obsessives and replaced them with a sense of immediacy and instant gratification.

            Mountain photography is a beautiful art. The serenity of the mountains and the breathtaking views of nature 
            evoke emotion like no other genre of photography can. One of the most fascinating aspects of mountain photography 
            is that no two photos are exactly alike But challenges are what make mountain photography truly enjoyable. Taking 
            on challenges is what makes photography truly rewarding. The beauty of the mountains is that they don't change. It 
            is always a struggle to find beauty in the mountains and it never gets old but mountain photography keeps the memories.
            The thrill of doing photography on a mountain is that you are always looking for something different, seeing things that 
            others don't. Every day when you get to wake up, hike, and photograph the mountains. It is a favourite way to spend your 
            free time.
